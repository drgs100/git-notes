# REAM ME

This is a set of personal notes for git, more reminders for myself rather than an explanation or tutorial. I have chosen to make public because git is becoming standard for version control at work, without anyone doing the hard work introducing it. Also it gave me a chance to practice using a remote repo. 

Feel free to use and share. If you notice any errors I'd appreciate a heads up.
